      <Text>My name is Diogo and I'm a full-stack web-developer. Currently based in Porto, Portugal.</Text>
      <Text>
        I'm passionate about building web apps with clean, tested and maintainable code, using the latest technologies.
        I have an aptitude for problem solving and a hunger for continuous improvement. I am looking to work as part of
        a team where I can contribute to meaningful projects, while learning from my peers. I work primarily with a
        JavaScript/TypeScript stack: NodeJS for back-end and React for front-end - but picking up new languages or
        frameworks is not a problem. I'm currently in the final year of a Masters degree in Electrical & Computer
        Engineering (Automation branch) at FEUP.
